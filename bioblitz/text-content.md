### Think of the 5 Ws: Who? What? When? Where? and Why?

Any effective communication strategy must answer these five questions otherwise the reader will feel like something is missing in their understanding of the message.



| 5Ws                                                                | Target Information                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Who?                                                               | JAC students                                                |
| What?                                                              | BioBlitz (what is a bioblitz?)                              |
| Where?                                                             | JAC/Ste-Anne                                                |
| When?                                                              | Date (spring time)                                          |
| Why?                                                               | Engage students in crowd-sourced scientific data collection |

You must find at least five images that will symbolize the answer to these questions:

- Find an image of someone who looks like a JAC student.
- Find an image of someone participating in the BioBlitz (using a cellphone outside in nature)
- Find an image that evokes Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue
- Find an image that evokes spring-time (in southern Quebec)
- Find an image that engages the reader with science
